simple readme for now

1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Subversion 1.2 rom in the roms folder - it must be named Subversion12.sfc
3.run Main.py in console

This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

Note: keep the outer folder named SubversionRando for everything to work as intended

Casual logic notes:
For now, casual logic is the only one published. More are possible and coming eventually. You could update the logicCasual file if you want a different experience. Casual logic is meant to mimic the "intended" experience of Subversion, with its few moments of suitless underwater movement, no hellruns, and no "gate glitches" in logic. Logic regarding the shutdown, space port, and Suzi is overly cautious so I would be surprised to find any progress there besides Torpedo Bay. In casual, Torpedo Bay (the vanilla missile) will always have morph or missile as your intended escape from the space port, then the very next pack of items that will be placed are Missile, Morph, and GravityBoots. If you are looking into the code, see the earlyItemList.
